## What is linear regression
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

## What is simple linear regression? 
Simple linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line. Both variables should be quantitative

>## Example
>We could use the equation to predict weight if we knew an individual's height. In this example, if an individual was 70 inches tall, we would predict his >weight to be: Weight = 80 + 2 x (70) = 220 lbs. In this simple linear regression, we are examining the impact of one independent variable on the outcome
